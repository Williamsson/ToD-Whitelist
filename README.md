# tod-whitelist
ToD-Whitelist plugin (with the theme bundled in here as well. 'Cause why not, i need to store it somewhere and it's only used in collaboration with this plugin).
Serverside plugin is managed in another repo by another person.

/wp-content/themes/hueman/ is not created by me, it's by Alexander "Alx" Agnarson - http://alxmedia.se and license and everything is in that folder.
